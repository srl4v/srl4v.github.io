Open PhD Researcher Position on Vision-based Anomaly Detection with Implicit Representations at Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Italy

There is an open PhD researcher position in anomaly detection from short video clips of produced parts at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano 
in collaboration with Schaeffler, a leading global supplier to the automotive and industrial sectors. 

The successful candidate will work on developing new vision-based anomaly detection approaches that build upon the success of implicit representation
learning. The goal is to develop a new generation of anomaly detection methods that leverage the representation power of neural radiance fields from 
short video clips acquired in a controlled environment. The research involves (i) neural radiance fields modelling to create digital twins of produced
parts from viewpoint and illumination variations in the video clips, and (ii) development of an unsupervised learning framework that exploits the 
implicit representations of digital twins for anomaly detection. The modeling will provide disentangled representations of geometry and appearance to
support defect detection in sequences of 2D images, 3D point cloud or depth maps.  

Position requirements: The eligible candidate has undertaken computer vision and deep learning studies at university courses with proficiency. 
The MSc thesis is in the field of deep learning and computer vision, ideally already providing the background on one aspect related to the project
and the research proposal by the applicant. Solid programming skills and experience with deep learning frameworks such as pytorch are requested.
 
The position is available for three years starting from November 2022 and offers the possibility to earn a PhD degree. The school offers an 
intellectually stimulating and international environment with sufficient freedom to pursue own research interests, and the group is also well 
connected to Covision Lab for technology transfer activities [2]. There is no teaching involved. Knowledge of German or Italian is not required. 
 
The application deadline is September 15th. Please send your expression of interest directly to Prof. Oswald Lanz at lanz@inf.unibz.it and read all 
the details here [3].

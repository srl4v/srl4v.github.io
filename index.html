<h1>SRL4V - Structured Representation Learning for Video</h1>

<p>Recent progress on spatio-temporal feature learning has pushed the state-of-the-art of action
recognition at new levels. Building upon the success of convolutional neural networks in image
recognition, currently best performing action recognition models introduce deep temporal modeling
in spatial 2D CNNs to handle time in video, with minimal overhead in parameters and computation.
They learn better features faster and with less supervision than space-time, full-3D CNNs. However,
such architectures lack the introspective means for grounded reasoning and decision making. Video
understanding relies on spatial-temporal reasoning to take place. Visual explanation methods are
being used to inspect video models after learning, but they are not yet applied to guide the learning.</p>
  
<p>This research project is set out to advance video understanding along these lines,
by lifting deep architectures for recognition and question answering by means of innate visual
explanations. Visual explanations will be built-in, and hence, interact in learning structured
representations. This way, the ’descriptor bottleneck’ of existing architectures will be eliminated
to facilitate visual grounding. The structural constraint injected via innate explanations will enable
training with less data at improved generalization, as constraints shape manifolds into the parameter
space that are hard to discover from point-wise supervisions alone.</p>
